# Coding Challenge - Unix WC Tool

## Introduction

Hi there, I did a coding challenge inspired by the ingenious John Crickett! In this endeavor, you are tasked with creating a simplified version of the Unix `wc` tool. The `wc` tool, a venerable utility in Unix environments, is known for counting lines, words, characters, bytes, and even determining the length of the longest line in a file.

## Challenge Overview

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves building a program that mirrors the fundamental functionality of the `wc` tool. Specifically, you will focus on handling the following options:

- `-l` for counting lines
- `-w` for counting words
- `-c` for counting bytes
- `-m` for counting characters

## Usage Instructions

To run your program, utilize the following syntax:

```bash
$ ./ccwc [options] filename
